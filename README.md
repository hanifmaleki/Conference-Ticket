## My process

I started by analyzing the project design and identifying the required HTML structure. Then, I created the basic layout using semantic HTML and applied styles using CSS custom properties. I used Flexbox and Grid to handle layout responsiveness. Finally, I implemented form behavior and validation using JavaScript.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

In this project, I practiced creating accessible forms and handling validation manually using JavaScript. I reinforced my understanding of the addEventListener method, input field event handling, and custom error messages. On the styling side, I improved my use of Flexbox and CSS Grid to create responsive designs.

### Continued development

In the next project, I plan to use SCSS to better manage styles and variables. I will also experiment with a lightweight HTML templating engine to keep my code more modular and organized.
